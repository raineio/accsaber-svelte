# AccSaber Svelte

### What is this project for?
This project is mostly for me and me alone. I needed an interactive
way to learn JS/TS, so this was mostly the way I thought it best for me.

As I've worked mostly with C#, JS/TS have been a little harder to work with.
But if I want to work in webdev professionally, I have to learn JS/TS at some point anyways.


### Building the app in a dev environment

This web app requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
Use the version you want.

Install Vite and Svelte through Node.js using npm
```bash
npm install svelte
npm install vite 
```
or using yarn
```bash
yarn add svelte
yarn add vite
```

Once you've installed Vite and Svelte all you need to run is
```bash
npm run dev
```
or 
```bash
yarn run dev
```

and open the app on [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000)
